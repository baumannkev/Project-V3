            - Press and hold the left mouse button to select the wave.
            - You also have the option to select the waves without clicking on the "Select" option.
        b) To Zoom-in to a specific part of a wave, press and hold the left mouse button and button up on your desired plae on wave.
            - The range of your selection, specifies the zooming scale. The wider your selection, the smaller is your zooming scale.
            - To scroll over the zoomed wave, use the white lined-out scrollbar on the bottom of the wave file.
    2. Data:
        a) To apply DFT, select a range of wave on the time domain, and click on "Descrete Fourier Transform" under "Data" option. This might take some seconds.
        b) To apply lowpass filter, select a range on the DFT graph, and click on "Lowpass Filter".
        c) To erase the modified waves, click on "Clear".
    3. Windows:
        a) To apply triangle windowing on your wave, select a range on the time domain, and click on "Triangle".
        b) To apply rectangle windowing on your wave, select a range on the time domain, and click on "Rectangle".
        c) To apply Welch windowing on your wave, select a tange on your time domain, and click on "Welch".
    4. Edit Wave:
        a) To reverse the wave, click on "Reverse".
        b) To amplify a specific part of your wave, select the range, and click on "Amplify".
            - Attention: Do not amplify the wave more than one time, as it crashes the application.
    5. Threads:
        Click on the number of threads you want to use for threading the DFT function, and then click on Data and then DFT the part of the wave selected. You will see the 
        benchmarking on the right side of the form in milliseconds.
        a) 1
        b) 2
        c) 3
        d) 4
    6. Sample Rate:
